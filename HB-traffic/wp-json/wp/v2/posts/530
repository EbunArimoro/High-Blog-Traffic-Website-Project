It\u2019s drab, empty and lifeless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frustrating, right? Well, here\u2019s the good news.

Not because you want to look odd in the crowd. And it\u2019s not because the speaker is a friend or relation- but because you believe deep inside, he earned it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what blogging is supposed to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you sit to write, think of yourself as standing on stage speaking to a real crowd and it\u2019s your job to Inspire your readers at the end of every post, give them something to feel you earn the online equivalent of applause (in the form of shares and comments).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make them excited to act and chances are they will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deep-seated question?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How the hell do public speakers and pro bloggers do it? What are the mechanics and elements of such speeches?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to realize that your writing is not just a collection of alphabets floating in cyberspace. You need to realize that writing is your deal, your calling and a means to an end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your headline and opening can stand out, but if you don\u2019t close well? Everything conks out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really want to get comments and shares?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to take a stand and stop the dumb things everyone else is doing.

Stick on to your keyboard<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve heard this advice over and over, right? Hand over the keyboard irrespective of what you say to your readers\u2026 Maybe they\u2019ll have something to say and so, you usually see phrases like \u201cover to you\u201d, \u201cwhat do you have to say?\u201d \u201cAsk a question\u201d or they freaking ask \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are always in a hurry to hand over their keyboard\u2026 and from a distance, it looks like a splendid and a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in reality?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those principles don\u2019t work anymore and I\u2019ve known it for a long time and remain quiet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what works?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Win them through empathy, so they demand the keyboard even before they finish reading the post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means speaking their fears back to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-2-talk-like-a-big-coach\"><strong>Step 2. Talk like a big coach<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m no football fanatic, but I know what coaches do right just before the game kicks off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They stir and motivate players with high-level pep talks \u2013 Injecting into them a fighting and hopeful spirit, so the players feel like taking over the pitch by storm and leaving nothing to chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing blog conclusions are not different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least not for the type that gets shared and wins clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When next you sit to write an amazing conclusion, think of yourself as a life coach. Transmit naked courage, confidence, and empower your readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what blog content is supposed to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powerful, engaging and hopeful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-3-sprinkle-poetic-alliterations\"><strong>Step 3. Sprinkle poetic alliterations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alliteration is a literary device that repeats a speech sound in a sequence of words that are close to each other. In other words, It\u2019s the deliberate repetition of phrases to make your ideas come alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come on; don\u2019t look at me as if you don\u2019t know what I am saying. Your English literature is littered with them. Many famous phrases, quotes and saying also use alliterations like stupid:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Busy as a bee<\/li><li>Dead as a doornail<\/li><li>Get your goat<\/li><li>Give up the ghost<\/li><li>Good as gold<\/li><li>Home sweet home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart bloggers and writers like Stephen king use them a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more examples of alliteration?

No!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Churchill used the power of poetic alliteration. Here\u2019s an excerpt:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-small-font-size\"><blockquote><p><em>You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air,&nbsp;with all our might&nbsp;and&nbsp;with all the strength&nbsp;that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word:&nbsp;Victory.&nbsp;Victory&nbsp;at all costs\u2014Victory&nbsp;in spite of all terror\u2014Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without&nbsp;victory&nbsp;there is no survival<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting, huh?

Add this magical spice<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wants to stand out and pull your readers in? Do the needful by adding this magical spice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told, it\u2019s short and usually ignored by the majority of writers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s so powerful and can mean the difference between success and failure for your writing career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last sentence\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it short and powerful.

You\u2019ve done the heavy lifting of speaking to their emotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, give them a chance to give input or get clarity on post ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his post&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-copywriting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u2018SEO Copywriting: The Definitive Guide <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20181017095321\/https:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-copywriting\">\u2019<\/a>&nbsp;Brian Dean over at backlinko uses the smart question technique in the conclusion of this post at backlinko and you can see comments rolling over.
