The morgue attendant opened a cabinet,\u00a0and brought out a file and then a sheet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your death certificate. Cause of death: massive internal trauma. The time of the death is 8:23pm. I&#8217;m sorry, there is nothing I can do for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, my God, what\u2019s happening? And why can\u2019t I move?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attendant got some wool, to clean up her bruised forehead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t touch me.

Elena had a little disagreement with her fiance amidst anger and tears she drove off only to discover she was in the mortuary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\u2019s gone for good.
